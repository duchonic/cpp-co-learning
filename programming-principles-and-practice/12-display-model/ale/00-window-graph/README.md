# Windows and Graph helper classes

This is the first example in section 12.3 with all the "helper" files by Stroustrup modified so that they compile: there are many errors, most of all in the `.h` files!

This [Programming Principle and Practice Forum thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ppp-public/BtlzdWGuQpQ) gives some clues on how to fix the files.

On Debian/Ubuntu you need to install

- libftlk1.3-dev

you get `fluid` a Gui builder for fltk.
