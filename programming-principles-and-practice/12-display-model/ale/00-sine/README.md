# Sine

Draw the sine curve from section 12.7.4 (Graphing a function) by using Qt.

The function to plot a function is implemented in a new Plotter class using Qt.

The sine function is passed to the plotter as a closure / lambda (in a similar way as in Stroutrup example, but in a more explicit way).
