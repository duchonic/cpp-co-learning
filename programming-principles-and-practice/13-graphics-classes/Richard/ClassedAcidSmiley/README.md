# Draw an Acid Smiley using FLTK

Homework for Session on 19 Jan 2016:

Take the Acid Smiley code from Chapter 12 (Sandra) and turn it into a class.

First change the mouth from a Polyline to an Arc following Bjarne's abstraction
in Graph.h and Graph.cpp.

Second take the smiley function and convert it into a class with a constructor.

# To Run:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:opentechschool-zurich/cpp-co-learning.git
cd programming-principles-and-practice/13-graphics-classes/Richard/ClassedAcidSmiley/
mkdir build
cd build
