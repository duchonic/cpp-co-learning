# HELP PLEASE!

In this folder you can find some header files plus some cpp files which I created to static making libraries. 
The main idea is as follows:
	-- the four_op header file declares and defines(inline) four main math operator
	-- the area header file declares some functions to caculate areas of different geometries
	-- area of each geometry is defined in individual cpp files
	-- the main function uses all above-mentioned declarationa nad definition to calculate some given areas.
The problem is altough I used include guards in header files, I encounter some error in compilation :(
