#+TITLE: Logistic Regression and the Titanic Data



* Logistic Regression
  - method to explain a binary outcome with other variables
  - example: probability of survival given age of passenger
    P(Y=1 | x) = F(x) = 1 / ( 1 + exp{-(b_0 + b_1 x)} )

  - [[http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html][Armadillo-documentation]] : MLpack uses the Armadillo C++ linear
    algebra library



* Application to Titanic Survival Data
  - data is on github =topics/machine-learning/logreg/=
  - data is taken from the [[https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic][Kaggle-site]] 
  - each row corresponds to a passenger
