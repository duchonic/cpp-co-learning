# Falling boxes

Use SFML and Box2d to draw boxes that fall down.

- Modifiy the sample to match the `init()`, `update()`, `render()` model.
- Use the newer SFML functions.

Status:

- It shows the falling rectangles but on my computer the area borders are not correct (and the boxes fall down down down...)
