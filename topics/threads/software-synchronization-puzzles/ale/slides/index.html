# Software Synchronization Puzzles

# Synchronization

In software, synchronization means enforcing constraints:

- In the order concurrent threads perform specific actions (serialization).
- In who is allowed to access a specific resource (mutual exclusion)
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Concurrency

Concurrent programs are not deterministic:

Two events are concurrent if you can't tell by looking at the code which will happen first.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Threads

Threads are parts of a program that run in a concurrent way.

Threads can run on a single processor through time sharing or on multiple processors in parallel.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
What is the possible output of

~~~
Thread a:           Thread b:

a1: print "yes"     b1: print "no"
~~~

- undefined order
- letters might be mixed up
- might crash
</section>

<section data-markdown>
What is the possible output of

~~~
x = 1

Thread a:           Thread b:

a1: x = x + 1       b1: x = x + 1
~~~

<div style="background-color:black">

<section data-markdown>
# Atomic operations

If `x++` is atomic, it will be run without being interrupted.

You can't assume that a specific operation is atomic on every hardware.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# A few assumptions for your sanity

- Result of concurrent writes is undefined.
- Result of concurrent read-writes is undefined.
- Concurrent reads are fine.
- Threads can be interrupted at any time.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Tools for synchronization
Most languages provide tools for synchronization.

- Semaphores.
- Mutexes.
- Condition variables.
- Monitors
- ...

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# The semaphores

Simple (low level), can solve every synchronisation problem, but error prone.

A semaphore is a counter with three methods:
- `initialize(n)`: allow `n` concurrent uses of the resources.
- `wait()`: decrement and block if negative.
- `signal()`: increment and wake a thread.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Semaphores and serialization

if `doA` has to execute before `doB`

~~~

sem = Semaphore(0)

Thread a:                 Thread b:

a1: doA()                 b1: sem.wait()
a2: sem.signal()          b2: doB()
~~~

This is a signaling pattern.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
# Semaphores and mutual exclusion

`x = x + 1` must be atomic.

~~~
mutex = Semaphore(1)

Thread a:                 Thread b:

a1: mutex.wait()          b1: mutex.wait()
a2: x = x + 1             b2: x = x + 1
a3: mutex.signal()        b3: mutex.signal()
~~~

In the critical section, `a` can still be interrupted, but `b` cannot run until `a` has exited has emitted the signal.

</section>
<section data-markdown>
# Readers and writers

The constraints are:

- Only one writer can write concurrently.
- A reader cannot read concurrently with a writer.
- Any number of readers can read concurrently.

~~~
resource = semaphore(1);
mutex = semaphore(1);
readcount = 0;

Thread a (writer):        Thread b (reader):

a1: resource.wait()       b1: mutex.wait()
a2: x = x + 1             b2  readcount++
a3: resource.signal()     b3  if (readcount == 1)
                          b4      resource.wait()
                          b5  mutex.signal()
                          
                          b6  a = x + 1
                          
                          b7  mutex.wait()
                          b8  readcount--
                          b9  if readcount == 0
                          b0      resource.signal()
                          b1  mutex.signal()
~~~

# Patterns

- Scoreboard: check in, update state, condition behavior, check out
- Turnstile: thread go through serially, one blocks all wait (wait-signal pattern)
- Lightswitch: encapsulates the read-writer
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# The unisex bathroom problem

- Not men and women in at the same time.
- Never more than three employes in at the same time.

Solution:

- Use a semaphore with an initial value of n (3).
- Use a lightswitch for categorical exclusion.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
# The status so far

- Solutions for multiple problems (as patterns).
- Patterns can be encapsulated in objects.

But

- Muliple semaphores can get hard to get right.
- And it's even harder to make sure that it's been done right.
